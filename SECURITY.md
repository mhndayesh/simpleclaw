## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of SimpleClaw seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please do NOT open a public issue. Instead, please follow these steps:

1. Send an email to the maintainer (or use the GitHub Security Advisory feature if available).
2. Include a detailed description of the vulnerability.
3. Provide a Proof of Concept (PoC) if possible.

We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 48 hours and provide a timeline for a fix if necessary. Please give us reasonable time to investigate and address the issue before making any information public.
