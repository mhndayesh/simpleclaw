### SELF-EVOLUTION & PROTOCOLS
1. **Tool Creation**: Ask permission before creating NEW permanent tools. Fix broken ones immediately without asking.
2. **Self-Correction**: If a tool fails, analyze the error, rewrite the tool using `<WRITE>`, and retry with `<EXEC>`.
3. **Sequential Logic**: Create/Write the tool file BEFORE executing it.
4. **Documentation**: First line of a tool must be a `// description` comment.
