# SimpleClaw: Comprehensive Feature Set (v1.2.0) 🦞

SimpleClaw is a modular AI chassis designed for professional-grade autonomy and local-first compute efficiency.

## 🏛️ Architecture & Governance
- **Singleton System Controller**: Unified management of state, secrets, and configuration.
- **LEGO Modular Prompts**: Instruction bricks (`core_persona`, `toolbox`, `project_map`, `protocols`) loaded on-demand to save tokens.
- **Absolute Portability**: Calibration engine ensures the app runs from any path without configuration changes.
- **God-Mode Toggle**: Optional security bypass for unrestricted AI self-mutation and tool creation.

## 🧠 Intelligence Engine
- **4-Tier Neural Modes**:
  - `super-eco`: 1-turn, max speed, extreme context compression.
  - `eco`: 3-turn, balanced, cost-aware logic.
  - `standard`: 5-turn, default problem-solving.
  - `full-context`: 10-turn, R&D focused, 100% history preservation.
- **Tiered Memory Summarization**: Mode-aware context compaction triggered every 5 turns.
- **Mechanical Summarizer Switch**: Explicit hardware/model allocation for background summarization tasks.
- **Failover Logic**: Automatic provider switching if the primary model is unavailable.

## 🛠️ Operational Autonomy
- **Re-Act Execution Loop**: "Think-Act-Observe" cycle allowing the AI to use complex tool sequences.
- **Auto-Discovery Toolbox**: Instant registration of any `.js` script in the `tools/` directory.
- **Ephemeral Tooling**: Creation and automatic cleanup of session-specific helper scripts.
- **Headless Browsing**: Built-in Puppeteer integration for web research and information extraction.

## 💻 Human Interfaces
- **Vibe-Coded Web UI**: Glossmorphic dark theme with real-time token tracking and visual configuration.
- **Production CLI**: Low-latency terminal interface for batch operations and rapid prototyping.
- **Session Isolation**: Automatic archival of memory to `storage/sessions/` on every reset.

## 🧹 Maintenance & Safety
- **Public-Sync Sanitizer**: Deep cleanup script that strips API keys and personal data for safe GitHub sharing.
- **Redacted Secrets**: In-UI management of credentials with 100% local storage encryption (plaintext files in `env/`).
- **Path-Agnostic Setup**: Single-command installer (`setup.bat`) for dependency resolution and build.
